# PyPerlinNoise
A complex algorithm for generating perlin noise in python.

# Changing
You can adjust the parameters in the main function inside main.py
Increasing zoom will increase the zoom.
Width and height are the dimensions.
Seed is the seed for generating the perlin noise.

# Gnerating
Run main.py to generate a simple perlin noise image. It will be saved as perlin.png
